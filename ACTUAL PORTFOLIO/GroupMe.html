            <P>TEAM: Rami Anguiano, Bert Dishman, Zachary Lowe, Derrick Springs</P><br>

           <h5>Product Concept Statement and Summary</h5> <br><br>
           <p>We have selected GroupMe to review for this assignment. GroupMe is a well-known platform for many users such as students and workers. There is not much of an incentive for users to choose this platform as of now with its lack of upgrading, thus creating an underwhelming user experience. We feel even with the most recent update that seemingly came out a week or two ago, there is still vast room for improvement. To adjust this platform we aim to revamp and add features to create a more user-friendly and modern experience. We want to become an essential part of your network, in your pocket.</p>
               <br><br>
            <p> GroupMe brands itself as “The easy way to connect with all the groups in your life, big and small”. That may have been true at some point, however considering the rapid advancement of technology, GroupMe is not meeting the growing standard. Compared to other communication-based apps like Discord and Slack, GroupMe is falling behind in innovative and useful features. With outdated messaging mechanics, there is not much of an incentive for users to choose this platform. If they do, users are met with an underwhelming user experience. In terms of the UX, it is difficult to send multiple photos, voice messages, and conference calls. Coupled with only being able to send 30-second videos. It’s hard to scroll back to find specific chats like searching for keywords in a chat as well. Unlike all the other instant messaging apps, we cannot delete or edit a message in real time. We want to modify and improve GroupMe’s features to create a more fluid and modern experience.</p> <br><br>
        
            <h1>RESEARCH</h1><br>
            <p>The research method required by this assignment was to recruit a small group of users and to interact with the product using the Context Inquiry Method. We had a total of 7 users ages ranging from 21-49 years old.</p><br><br>
           <p> User Search Tasks:</p>

<p>Start a group and invite other participants to the group?</p>
            <p>How to pin and archive a chat on mobile?</p>
            <p> Demographic Information</p>
<p>We have a quite diverse demographic with a collective Age range of 21 to 49 years old. The majority of our participants do have some type of experience with GroupMe, and most if not all of them got associated with the app due to School. </p><br>
            <img src ="demotablepic.png"/><br>
            <h4>Interview</h4><br>
            <p>During the interviews most of the people being interviewed used Group me for work or school. Everyone will not be using Group Me outside of work or school. This is not the first app people use for communication. Each person that was interviewed thought that Group Me is a simple app to use. Most of the users interviewed want more customization in the app.  
</p>
            <p>The way we structured our jam board/WAAD was in line with how we asked our participants. 
So demographic -> GroupMe History -> Other apps used to communicate-> uses outside school/work -> opinions on current design-> improvements. Lastly just random observations from user tasks. Ranging from the device they used to the speed of completion of the task. At first, we put all our notes onto the board and then kept the non-repetitive notes. Then to make this efficient we kept the most crucial data and organized them with certain keywords.

            <p>I was the only one who had some familiarity of Figma, so the role of prototyping was hard on me. I ened up using Figma, as it was the easiest platforms for my members to access.</p>

                 <h1>FEEDBACK/REFLECTIONS</h1><br>
                <p>Working on this assignment found that working with a group has its positives and negatives. It was hard to begin but once we got an understanding through discussions we were able to get something down and from there we could delegate work.  There was an issue of sticky hands though where a few people kept messing with my delegated work. Time management was a bit tricky, but with teamwork and discussion we got it. 
</p>
                <p>Something that I have also been struggling with is the lack of feedback. No one in my group was in UXD, so getting appliable feedback in the design process was hard. I did my best to research other mobile apps and basic mobile UI, however there was a limit to my design process. This being my second project I do now know the extent in which I do not know. I am excited to learn more tools to help me move foward in my design process.</p> <br>
