        <h1>E-LINK 2.0</h1><br>
           <center><img src="ELINK2.0HEADER.png"/></center><br>
            <P>E-Link is a data repostory for scientific and technical information (STI) sponsored by the the Department of Energy (DOE). </P><br>
             <center><P>"E-Link facilitates the electronic submittal of STI between DOE and its client community including researchers, reviewers, research administrators, and others doing business with DOE. STI deliverables provided to DOE through E-Link are announced, as appropriate, on web products maintained by OSTI, which provide free and convenient public access to full text and bibliographic data of products resulting from DOE-funded research." </P><br></center>
            <center><P>Source: E-LINK</P></center>
    
            <h1>INTERSHIP OVERVIEW</h1><br>
            <P>The intern and applications team memebers will collaborate to:</P>
            <ul>
            <li>Support OSTI's work of collectin, preserving, and dmisseminating scientfic and techinal informations (STII) resulting from DOE-funded research and development
            increase the intern's knowledge of information science services, products, and systems in a federal environment;and</li>
            <li>Create usuable mockups and analysis for OSTI products.</li>
                <li>Determine key tasks for E-Link 2.0, measure their performance, and creat metrics based on those results.</li>
                <ul>
            

   <h1>Research</h1><br>
                    <p>I got to talk to three people who actively used E-LINK. From here I learned that the main users of the platform where the IS team who handled curation and enhance. The other users would be a lab member who would submit STI which then would be left for the IS team to quality check.</p> <br>
     <center><img src="%E2%80%9CI%20don%E2%80%99t%20feel%20like%20I%20am%20working%20E-Link,%20I%20feel%20like%20we%20are%20working%20around%20it%E2%80%9D.png"/></center> 
           <br><br> <br><br>
        
               <h1>BENCHMARK ANALYSIS</h1><br>
            <P>E-LINK Overall review Comparisons:
 In comparison to E-LINK,  other repositories allow for a more user-centered and fluid user experience. Other repositories offer a more modernized simple navigation, responsive design, and relevant visual elements.
 NMDC for example utilizes button visuals to direct guide behavior to a relevant source such as “Submission Portal”. 
                The color schemes in these other websites do not interfere with readability as much as e-link.</P>

            <H1>DESIGN PROCESS</H1><br><br>
        <P>I tried to do some simple wireframing however in my process I ended up with something that looked more along the lines of low-fidelity </P>
            <br><br>
                <h1>Wireframe</h1>
            <div class="analysis-content">
                <div>
                    <h5>General UI </h5>
                    <p>
                        Rationale: I wanted to follow the industry standards that I extracted from my benchmark analysis such as a simple color scheme. The logo of Elink was an asset that I took from the backend team. I wanted to streamline the archeticture of information as well. The original E-Link had a lot of color to it so to stick close to that brand I encorporated some gradients in the design.
                        <br>
    
                        <br> <h5>Submission Proccess and Curation </h5>
                        <p>The Submission and Curation categories were very hard for me to figure out what would work the best. E-Link was something that an IS team member would be trained on for a few months, while I needed to learn the gist of it within a few weeks to start the design process. In most of my benchmarks, other sides opted for a side search bar with a lot of filters. NOTE: After I made this wireframe I was able to find the work flow for the searches by the curation team. They actually tend to find STI by OSTI number, so the need for the side search bar was not the most effective. 
                        <br>
                        Note: The user group will be students, faculty, and general VOL fans so the design needs to be
                        direct for general understanding and accessibility.

            <h1>Design and Presentation</h1><br>

            <p>At the moment I am waiting for my internship to share my final presentation with me. </p>
            <br>
  
            <br> <br>
            <h1>Project Takeaways</h1><br>
            <p>It was very interesting to do UX with a lot of specific limiations. Since they was comminsioned for the Department of Energy there was a lot of specific rhectoric and guidlines I needed to find.</p><br>
            <li>I had never made a high-fidelity prototype to this extent, so while I am still improving on this skill I  became a lot more familiar with the more advanced features of figma.</li><br>
